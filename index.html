Later in life, I would help create <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/home" target="_blank">Paypal</a>, become a multi-millionaire after selling my shares, and move on to turn my dreams into a reality. In May 2002, I founded <a href="https://www.spacex.com/" target="_blank">SpaceX</a> and joined <a href="https://www.tesla.com/" target="_blank">Tesla Motors</a>, Inc. The first few steps were a bit wobbly, and we tripped a few times, but we made it in the end and now are one of the most valuable companies on Earth. I started off small but managed to grow big.

                    <br> I joined Tesla Motors, an electric vehicle manufacturer, in 2004, the year after it was founded. I assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008, a position I still hold today. As of 2020, I am the longest-tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally. Within my leadership, Tesla has become the most valuable automotive company in the world and has changed the automotive sector to a greener side as a whole. As of December 2020, I am the second richest person in the world due to Tesla shares soaring to all-time highs month after month, and am ahead of all other automotive companies by years. Tesla is the leader of the EV sector, and we plan on expanding even more. We are building bigger and better batteries for our cars and homes, developing the safest cars and the most advanced AIs for our vehicles. It is my goal to lead humanity into a New Era of green-tech and while Tesla is the current leader in this field, we will keep improving.

                    <br><a href="https://www.spacex.com/" target="_blank">SpaceX</a> was formed by me in the hopes of revolutionizing the aerospace industry. My dream was to make rockets that were reusable, greener for the environment, affordable, and practical. We entered the business with the Falcon 1 rocket, a two-stage liquid-fueled craft designed to send small satellites into orbit. We failed quite a lot of times early on, but in the end, we managed to fly our rocket and started working as a private space company to develop our rockets and to transport goods or people to space and back.<br>

            <h3>How Elon Musk Inspired Me</h3>
            <p>Elon started very small compared to where he is now. He did things many thought to be impossible and proved em all wrong. He is the definition of IRL Ironman, and he is nowhere close to finished. I believe Elon will lead the world to a smarter and greener future with his companies Tesla and SpaceX, along with his many other projects he comes up with on Twitter.</p>
